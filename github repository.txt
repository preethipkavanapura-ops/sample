GitHub is a proprietary developer platform that allows developers to create, store, manage, and share their code. It is a web-based platform that uses Git, an open-source version control system, to facilitate collaboration and track changes in code. 
Key Features and Aspects of GitHub:
•	Version Control: 
At its core, GitHub utilizes Git to enable users to track changes in their code over time, revert to previous versions, compare different versions, and understand the history of a project.
•	Repositories: 
Projects on GitHub are stored in "repositories" (or "repos"), which are central locations containing all the project files and folders, along with their complete history of changes. Repositories can be public or private.
•	Collaboration: 
GitHub is designed for collaboration, allowing multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously. Features like branches and pull requests facilitate this process.
•	Branches: 
Branches enable parallel development, allowing developers to work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase until their changes are ready to be merged.
•	Pull Requests: 
Developers can propose changes to a project by creating pull requests, which allow other collaborators to review the code, provide feedback, and ultimately merge the changes into the main branch.
•	Issue Tracking: 
GitHub includes tools for tracking bugs, feature requests, and other tasks related to a project.
•	Project Management: 
It offers features for project management, including task management, continuous integration, and wikis for documentation.
•	Cloud-based: 
As a cloud-based platform, GitHub allows users to access and manage their code from anywhere with an internet connection.
